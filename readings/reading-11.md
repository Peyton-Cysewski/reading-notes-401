# EF Core and APIs

## Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write.

## APIs
In ASP.NET Core you have the ability to add user secrets to your API. User secrets is a secure way of storing private user information such as API keys, client secrets, and connection strings, or anything that you donâ€™t want others to know about when using your code base. These are not uploaded to any source control. They stay local and remain "secret".
