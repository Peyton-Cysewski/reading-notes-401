# Intro to Databases

## What is a Database?
A database is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information. Data usually represents record-able facts. Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts. For example, if there is data about scores obtained by students, then conclusions can be drawn about their GPAs and GPA distribution.

## What is Database Management System?
A database management system (DBMS) refers to a system that allows users with different accessibility levels and responsibilities to have access to different parts of a database. This can be as simple as having an Admin team with full access and the commercial Users who would have relatively limited access in comparison.

## What is a Database Schema?
A schema is essentially a visual representation of a database. It acts as a set of relational rules that the database must adhere to. Schemas are as broad as definition as they are in practice. For example, a schema could describe how a table is formed, with certain columns that have certain values, names, and references to other tables. A schema could also describe what access a certain user has. They could have access to every table, or just one. Both of these examples are rules by which a database is governed.

## What is a Key
Keys are what are used to find specific data in a database. In other words, they can act as a search parameter in a query. Often times in relational databases, keys are in reference to a bigger object, like a user, that has connections across multiple tables. An easy way to gather all the related information is with keys. All objects related to the user would have a column meant to be a direct tie to them. Therefore, to gather information on the user, even if it is spread out across many database tables, would be to search by key for references to them.
