# 401 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This repository will be filled with notes from the various readings that are done during the CodeFellows Code 401 course on ASP.NET Core. The goal is for each entry to be clear and offer a summary of the reading that can be referenced by me later or for another person to see and learn from.
