# 401 Reading Notes

## Introduction

This repository will be filled with notes from the various readings that are done during the CodeFellows Code 401 course on ASP.NET Core. The goal is for each entry to be clear enough to offer a summary of the reading that can be referenced by myself later or for another person to see and learn from.
